- **RepositoryCoverageImprovementResult**: New DTO for repository-wide coverage results
- **ProgressUpdate**: WebSocket progress tracking model
- **CoverageImprovementSession**: Session management model with status tracking
- **GeneratedTestInfo**, **TestValidationResult**, **BatchTestGenerationResult**: Supporting models

### 2. Service Layer Enhancements
- **AsyncCoverageProcessingService**: 
  - Async background processing with session management
  - Repository-wide batch coverage improvement logic
  - Real-time progress updates via WebSocket
  - Session cancellation support
  - Error handling and recovery

- **CoverageAgentService**: 
  - Batch processing capabilities
  - Type conversion and validation
  - Enhanced error handling

- **TestGenerationService**: 
  - Batch test generation and validation
  - Compilation and execution testing

- **SessionManagementService**: 
  - Session lifecycle management
  - Progress tracking and status updates
  - Results storage and retrieval

### 3. WebSocket Integration
- **CoverageProgressWebSocketHandler**: Real-time progress updates
- **WebSocketConfig**: Proper WebSocket endpoint configuration
- Session-based progress broadcasting

### 4. REST API Endpoints
- `POST /api/coverage/file/improve-async`: Start async file coverage improvement
- `POST /api/coverage/repo/improve-async`: Start async repository coverage improvement
- `POST /api/coverage/session/{sessionId}/cancel`: Cancel running session
- `GET /api/coverage/file/session/{sessionId}/status`: Get file session status
- `GET /api/coverage/repo/session/{sessionId}/status`: Get repo session status
- `POST /api/coverage/file/session/{sessionId}/apply`: Apply file coverage changes
- `POST /api/coverage/repo/session/{sessionId}/apply`: Apply repository coverage changes

### 5. Frontend Integration
- **file-coverage-client.js**: JavaScript client for WebSocket and API integration
- **coverage-improvement.html**: Comprehensive UI for both file and repository coverage improvement
- Real-time progress tracking with cancellation support
- Modal-based user interface with form validation

### 6. Enhanced Repository Processing
- Batch file processing (5 files per batch)
- Intelligent file filtering and exclusion patterns
- Progress tracking with detailed status updates
- Error recovery for individual file failures
- Configurable processing limits

## üöÄ Key Capabilities

### File Coverage Improvement
- Target specific Java files for coverage improvement
- Configurable coverage increase targets (10-50%)
- Batch test generation with validation
- Real-time progress tracking
- Session-based processing with cancellation

### Repository Coverage Improvement
- Process multiple files in batches
- Intelligent file discovery and filtering
- Exclude patterns support (test files, target directories)
- Configurable file processing limits
- Comprehensive progress reporting

### Session Management
- Unique session IDs for tracking
- Persistent session storage in MongoDB
- Status tracking (CREATED, ANALYZING, PROCESSING, COMPLETED, FAILED, CANCELLED)
- Results storage and retrieval
- Error handling and recovery

### Real-time Progress Tracking
- WebSocket-based progress updates
- Progress percentage and status messages
- Step-by-step processing information
- Error notifications
- Completion notifications

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Benefits

### Scalability
- Async processing prevents blocking
- Batch processing for large repositories
- Configurable resource limits
- Background session management

### User Experience
- Immediate session start with progress tracking
- Cancellation support for long-running processes
- Detailed progress information
- Modal-based UI with clear status indicators

### Maintainability
- Modular service architecture
- Separation of concerns
- Comprehensive error handling
- Extensible session management

### Reliability
- Robust error handling and recovery
- Session persistence across restarts
- Individual file failure isolation
- Comprehensive logging
