     * You provided the heart of every Java application: the **main method**. Let's break down its purpose and key features:
     *
     * **Purpose:**
     *
     * - **Entry Point:** This method acts as the starting line for your Java program. When you execute your application, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) looks for and calls this specific `main` method to begin execution.
     *
     * **Key Features:**
     *
     * - **`public`:** This keyword ensures the `main` method is accessible from anywhere, including outside the class it's defined in. This accessibility is crucial for the JVM to initiate your program.
     * - **`static`:**  This keyword indicates that the `main` method belongs to the class itself (`JavadocGeneratorAiApplication` in this case) rather than any specific instance (object) of the class. Since the JVM needs to start your program without creating an object first, `static` is essential.
     * - **`void`:** This signifies that the `main` method doesn't return any specific value back to the caller (the JVM in this context).
     * - **`main`:** This is the magic name! The JVM specifically searches for a method named "main" to begin execution.
     * - **`String[] args`:** This parameter allows you to pass command-line arguments to your Java program. Any arguments you provide when running the program from the command line will be stored as strings in this `args` array.
     *
     * **In the context of your code:**
     *
     * - `SpringApplication.run(JavadocGeneratorAiApplication.class, args);` suggests you're working with a Spring Boot application. This line bootstraps your Spring application:
     *     - It starts up the Spring container, which manages the components (beans) of your application.
     *     - It handles common configurations and setups required for a Spring Boot application to run.
     *
     * **In essence, this `main` method is the ignition key that starts your Spring Boot application, and the `SpringApplication.run` line takes care of getting your Spring engine up and running.**
     *
     * @param args TODO: Add parameter description.
