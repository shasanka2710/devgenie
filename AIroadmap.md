## Tools (On-Demand Operations)

### **Fast Tools (< 100ms)**
- `get_cached_patterns(framework, classType)` - Retrieve pre-computed test patterns
- `get_class_context(className)` - Get cached dependency relationships
- `get_project_utilities()` - List available test utilities and builders
- `get_domain_rules(packagePath)` - Get business rules for package

### **Medium Tools (< 1s)**
- `analyze_similar_methods(methodSignature)` - Find similar methods in codebase
- `get_test_coverage_gaps(className)` - Identify specific uncovered paths
- `validate_test_approach(testStrategy)` - Validate proposed test strategy

### **Slow Tools (1-5s - Use Sparingly)**
- `deep_dependency_analysis(className)` - Complex dependency chain analysis
- `business_logic_inference(methodBody)` - Infer business rules from implementation
- `generate_edge_cases(methodComplexity)` - Create complex edge case scenarios

## Technical Implementation Details

### **Storage Strategy**
```yaml
MongoDB Collections:
  - repository_intelligence: Pre-computed patterns per repository
  - test_patterns: Framework-specific templates
  - class_relationships: Dependency graphs
  - success_metrics: Pattern performance data

Vector Database:
  - code_embeddings: Semantic code similarity
  - test_embeddings: Test pattern similarity
  - domain_embeddings: Business rule patterns
```

### **Integration Points**
```java
// Enhance existing services
RepositoryAnalysisService: + buildIntelligenceCache()
TestGenerationService: + getRAGContext() + executeTools()
SessionManagementService: + trackRAGMetrics()
```

### **Performance Targets**
```yaml
RAG Retrieval: < 100ms
Tool Execution: < 1s (fast), < 5s (slow)
Cache Build: During existing repository analysis
Storage Overhead: < 50MB per repository
```

## Success Metrics

### **Quality Improvements**
- Test compilation success: 70% → 95%
- Coverage improvement: +15% → +25% average
- Manual modification rate: 30% → 10%

### **Performance Targets**
- Test generation latency: +200ms max overhead
- Repository analysis: +10% processing time
- Cache hit rate: >90% for common patterns

### **Business Value**
- Developer time saved: +40% improvement
- Test quality consistency: +60% improvement
- Framework adoption: Support for 5+ major frameworks

## Risk Mitigation

### **Technical Risks**
- **Embedding quality:** Start with simple pattern matching, evolve to semantic
- **Storage costs:** Implement intelligent purging of old patterns
- **Performance degradation:** Comprehensive caching and fallback strategies

### **Business Risks**
- **Implementation complexity:** Phased rollout with clear success criteria
- **ROI timeline:** Focus on high-impact patterns first
- **User adoption:** Transparent performance improvements without workflow changes

## Backlog Prioritization

### **P0 (Must Have)**
- Core test pattern extraction and caching
- Fast lookup tools integration
- Basic RAG retrieval for common frameworks

### **P1 (Should Have)**
- Advanced pattern recognition
- Context-aware test generation
- Performance optimization

### **P2 (Nice to Have)**
- Advanced analytics and learning
- Organization-wide pattern sharing
- Complex dependency analysis tools

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

### **ADR-001: Hybrid RAG + Tools Approach**
**Decision:** Implement hybrid approach combining pre-computed RAG database with on-demand tools
**Rationale:** Balances latency requirements (< 1s) with intelligence quality for enterprise scale
**Alternatives Considered:** Pure RAG, Pure Tools, Agent-based approach
**Trade-offs:** Medium complexity for optimal performance

### **ADR-002: Vector Database Selection**
**Decision:** Start with ChromaDB for development, evaluate Pinecone for production
**Rationale:** ChromaDB offers self-hosted option for enterprise data privacy
**Alternatives Considered:** Weaviate, Qdrant, PostgreSQL with pgvector
**Trade-offs:** Vendor lock-in vs. feature richness

### **ADR-003: Integration Strategy**
**Decision:** Enhance existing services rather than creating new microservices
**Rationale:** Minimizes architectural complexity and deployment overhead
**Alternatives Considered:** Separate RAG service, Event-driven architecture
**Trade-offs:** Service coupling vs. operational simplicity

## Implementation Notes

### **Development Considerations**
- Use feature flags for gradual rollout
- Implement comprehensive metrics from day one
- Build with A/B testing capability for pattern effectiveness
- Design for horizontal scaling from the start

### **Testing Strategy**
- Unit tests for pattern extraction algorithms
- Integration tests for RAG retrieval performance
- Load tests for enterprise-scale repositories
- Quality tests comparing RAG vs. non-RAG generated tests

### **Monitoring & Observability**
- Pattern usage analytics
- Retrieval latency metrics
- Quality improvement tracking
- Cache hit/miss ratios
- Tool execution performance

This roadmap provides a clear path to implement RAG + Tools hybrid approach while maintaining DevGenie's enterprise performance requirements and scalability goals.
